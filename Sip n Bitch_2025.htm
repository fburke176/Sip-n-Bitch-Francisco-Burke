              <p> Unlike capitalism, socialist governments are involved in many aspects of the economy. This means that they determine the amount of output (or supply) and the pricing levels of these goods and services rather than the free market. People in socialist economies may depend on the state for food, employment, healthcare, and other basic goods.” (Investopedia, 2015). </p>

                Because the phone market is an<strong> Oligopoly</strong> with a few companies producing the same product, the one with the highest market power (Apple), has the power to influence the price 
                The same goes for a Monopolistic power, an example is the current housing market and healthcare. </p>

              <p> In <strong>Perfect Competition Market</strong>, The Price is equal to the marginal cost of production. This means when you purchase a product you are paying fairly, and the company producing the product pays fairly for production cost. 
                In a perfect competition market, multiple businesses produce the same product. 
                This means they do not have the power to set the price because they need to follow the trends of other companies selling similar products. </p>
